gojson
===========

gojson is a simple command-line tool for manipulating JSON for use in developing Go code.


Example
----------

Given a file json_example.json which contains some sample JSON data, gojson will generate a valid Go struct definition and infer the appropriate types.

````
> ./gojson -file json_example.json 
package main

type TestStruct struct {
        glossary struct {
                GlossDiv struct {
                        GlossList struct {
                                GlossEntry struct {
                                        ID        string
                                        Acronym   string
                                        GlossTerm string
                                        GlossDef  struct {
                                                GlossSeeAlso []interface{}
                                                para         string
                                        }
                                        SortAs   string
                                        Abbrev   string
                                        GlossSee string
                                }
                        }
                        title string
                }
                title string
        }
        _comment string
}
````

Or, more succintly:

````
> ./gojson -file json_example.json > example_struct.go
````

Any error messages will be printed to STDERR, so if the above command produced no output, you now have a valid Go source file named example_struct.go which contains the desired struct definition. 

The output will already be properly formatted according to `go fmt`.

Installation
----------

You probably don't want to have to clone the git repository to your current directory or use an absolute path to the binary each time you want to create a new struct. Installation is easy:

````
# make install
````

Now, you can access gojson from any directory.

By default, this will install to /usr/local/bin, which will probably require root permissions. If INSTALL_PATH is defined as a (non-empty) environment variable, the binary will be installed to that location instead. For example, a non-system-wide installation

````
> export INSTALL_PATH=~/bin
> make install                      #no root permission needed
````

(Make sure that the directory specified in INSTALL_PATH is in your $PATH)


License 
----------

gojson is free software distributed under Version 3 of the GNU Public License. 

As of the time of writing, this is the same license used for gcc (and therefore gccgo), so it is unlikely to restrict use in any way. Note that the GPL does not extend to any output generated by gojson; the GPL only applies to software which includes copies of gojson itself.
